# Naming

Use task names that work as both directory suffix and git branch name.

## Recommended patterns

- `feat-<ticket>-<short>`
- `fix-<ticket>-<short>`
- `chore-<ticket>-<short>`

Examples:

- `feat-123-auth-flow`
- `fix-941-tauri-window-crash`
- `chore-ci-cache`

## Notes

- Avoid spaces.
- Avoid long names. Keep under ~50 chars.
- Prefer hyphens.
- If you need grouping, encode it: `feat-auth-ui-1`, `feat-auth-ui-2`.
